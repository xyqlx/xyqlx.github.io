## Introduction

A simple example of raining effect simulation using WebGL

## Background

xyqlx loves rain.

But recently, he had the idea of writing this project, probably because of "Symphonic Rain".

WebGL is quite interesting, but considering compatibility and development difficulty, frameworks like PixiJS may be a better choice.

## How to run

open `index.html` in your browser

## Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| startPosition | the level of water |
| k | the stiffness of the spring |
| density |  the dampening factor |
| spread | how fast the waves spread |
| piova | the amount of raindrops |
| raindropVelocity | the vertical velocity of rain |
| windVelocity | the horizontal velocity of rain |

## Performance Optimization

In the old version, when the value of piova reached 500, the FPS would noticeably decrease. Upon inspecting the code, it was discovered that each raindrop was being drawn using a separate draw call, leading to performance degradation.

Therefore, in [commit f6a5249](https://github.com/xyqlx/rain/commit/f6a524925783ad5661ed6425d0c03d1b756d931c), the change from "drawing gl.TRIANGLE_FAN in a for loop" to "drawing gl.TRIANGLES in a single call" significantly improved performance ðŸ˜™. Now, it can easily handle over 10,000 piova.

## Other Implemented Features

- Display of FPS and the number of raindrops on the field
- Ability to set parameters using URL Query Strings
- Addition of input boxes to set parameters beyond the slider range, triggering animations when the slider's upper and lower limits are changed.

## Problems

- If you toggle the page to background and then toggle back, the animation may be paused
- I don't know what's the best parameters for the simulation

## TODO

Actually, xyqlx wants to add rain sound.

xyqlx is struggling whether to simulate it using pure sine waves or use existing rain sound effects.
