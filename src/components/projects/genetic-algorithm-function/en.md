## Introduction

Undergraduate course project that utilizes genetic algorithm to visualize the maximum value within a function interval on a web page.

## Background

This might be one of the earliest projects by xyqlx that showcased visualization on a web page and was shared on a public code repository.

At that time, xyqlx simply used the code repository as a static web hosting service, so only the "dist" folder of Vue was uploaded. The source code in the GitHub repository is retrieved from an archived folder and only contains the key code.

By the way, xyqlx has been a Vue developer for four years now :)

## Usage

There are two aspects that can be modified:

* Problem definition: including the function expression f(x) and the interval [a, b].
* Genetic algorithm parameters: including population size, chromosome length, generations, crossover count, crossover probability, mutation probability, and fitness offset.

The "Max Value" text box is actually a read-only text box used to display the current maximum value.

The two charts on the right are relatively easy to understand. The chart on the left displays the function graph within the domain, while the chart on the right displays the iteration results.

The "Compute" button below is actually redundant because as soon as the parameters are modified, the computation will start automatically.

## Summary of the Experiment Report

Fortunately, xyqlx found the undergraduate experiment report, and here are some additional excerpts.

### Objective of the Experiment

To familiarize and master the basic ideas and methods of genetic algorithms, cultivate students' basic skills in using genetic algorithms to solve problems, and understand the basic ideas and methods of other branches of evolutionary computation.

### Algorithm Process

The basic process of a simple genetic algorithm is as follows:

1. Initialize the population: randomly generate an initial population consisting of feature strings of a fixed length.
2. Calculate the fitness value of each individual in the population.
3. Select individuals to enter the next generation based on a rule determined by their fitness values, i.e., selection operator.
4. Perform crossover operator on individuals in the mating pool with a probability of Pc.
5. Perform mutation operator on all new individuals generated by the crossover operator with a probability of Pm.
6. If a certain stopping condition is not met, go to step 2; otherwise, proceed to the next step.
7. Output the chromosome with the best fitness value in the population as the satisfactory or optimal solution to the problem.

### Experiment Content

Write a program to use a genetic algorithm to find the maximum value of the function f(x) = x*sin(10Ï€+x)+1.0 in the interval [-1, 2].

### Experiment Details

| Attribute | Description |
|---|---|
| Encoding and Decoding | Binary encoding and decoding based on equal divisions of the interval. |
| Fitness Function | Function value + offset value (to ensure positive fitness values). |
| Selection Method | Proportional selection. |
| Crossover | Multi-point crossover. |
| Mutation | Fixed probability mutation. |
| Termination Condition | Reached the maximum number of generations. |

### Questions for Consideration

1. What is premature convergence and slow termination? What are the causes of these situations?
2. Does your program have any areas for improvement? How can it be improved?

Answers:

1. Premature convergence refers to a situation where all values in the population get stuck in a local optimum and cannot find a better solution. The causes of premature convergence are mainly a small population size, a small mutation probability, and excessive selection pressure. Slow termination refers to a situation where after a certain number of generations, most of the population has converged but has not stabilized at the global optimum.
2. An improvement could be to add extension interfaces for changing the selection operator, crossover operator, and mutation operator.

## Issue

I tried it and found a bug. There is a problem with the display of the function graph. It may be that when recalculating the function values, the original data is not completely refreshed.
